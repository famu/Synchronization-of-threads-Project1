# Synchronization-of-threads-Project1
This project demonstrates the synchronization of multiple threads without using wait command. This project doesn't take any
input. There are three types of threads used in this project named as Clock, Visitors and Speaker each with some jobs and 
routines. The output file can further describe what each and every thread is doing in code.
Note: the output file format is such that every line represents an action performed by a thread where the number in square
bracket [] shows the time action perform at.
